# UndergraduateProject
My final year project- investigating structural design for ER Diagrams.


# ER-diagram-tool

The goal of this project was to investigate and develope a solution for the creation of Entity relationship diagrams. The project was underpinned by the idea of structural design, 
and how it can provide a structured avenue into designing a database. 
This project involved developing a tool whereby a user is able to create an ER diagram using either a top down approach or a bottom up approach in a step by step procedure. 
A user is able to edit, save and restore a diagram. Also able to generate SQL From a Valid ER diagram using underlying database theory to reduce any excess tables.
